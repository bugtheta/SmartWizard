The red wizard is controlled by AI or Player and the blue warrior is hard-code, which will also rush for the wizard and use his sword to attack the wizard. The wizard has to keep running to keep distance from the warrior and find a chance to fight back with his adept fire ball magic.

# Rewards
1. Get reward when defeat or hurt the warrior.
2. Get punishment (negative reward) when being hurt.
3. Get small reward when still alive.

# Demo

# Sample 2: Avoid The Bombs!
Another game. 
This time the wizard is facing with the attacks from some future civilizations. Unfortunately his magic does not work for the high-tech aircraft. Just try to run away!
